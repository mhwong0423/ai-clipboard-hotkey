# ai-clipboard-hotkey
This is a very simple tool (available on Windows OS for now) that helps you quickly send frequent requests to an AI. You can save your common instructions and bind them to hotkeys from Alt+1 to Alt+5. When you copy text to the clipboard and press a hotkey, the tool will send the saved instruction along with your clipboard content to the AI.
