This is a very simple tool (available on Windows OS for now) that helps you quickly send frequent requests to an AI. You can save your common instructions and bind them to hotkeys from Alt+1 to Alt+5. When you copy text to the clipboard and press a hotkey, the tool will send the saved instruction along with your clipboard content to the AI.

For example, if you often summarize web parag!
raphs, you can save the instruction \"Summarize this paragraph\". Then, after copying a paragraph, just press the hotkey (e.g., Alt+1), and the tool will automatically send it to the AI. Once the response is ready, the tool copies the AI's reply to your clipboard, so you can paste it (Ctrl+V) directly into any editor — speeding up your workflow.

This tool does not include any built-in AI API keys. You need to subscribe to an AI service yourself, enter your own API key at the top of the tool, and it will be encrypted and saved locally on your hard disk.
